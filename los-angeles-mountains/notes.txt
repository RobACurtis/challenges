Hello! I have attached some questions about the rest of the assessment.


I noticed in the directions I was told to include an accordion for the links.
I have worked with accordions in the past, I know how to code them, however one of my complications
is I am unsure if each section should have its own accordion? There are two navbars total one for each page.
Also, the PSD was not designed for mobile view. Meaning, there are some complications with the text and images on smaller screen sizes.
The background images are not dark enough and the text is hard to read.

As far as the image carousel, I was also unsure what the goal of it was. Should the user click an image to rotate it?
Does the image expand or replace the background image? Should there be more images hidden from view that appear when the user clicks an image?

I stopped working on this assessment when I ran into these questions, I could of course continue to code it how I think it should be.
But in my experience it is always better to ask clarifying questions, than make something
that was unnecessary and complicate the process or frustrate the team. I like to give exactly what was requested of me.

Also the allotted time was 60 minutes for this part of the assessment, and I spent a few hours extra working on this and I wasn't totally sure when I should stop.

Thanks!
Rob
